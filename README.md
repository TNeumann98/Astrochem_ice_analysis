# Astrochem_ice_analysis
This repository should provide an extended tool for the analysis of spectral data and the investigation of ices (frozen molecules) in proto-stellar envelopes and other cool environments. 

The aim is the unification and optimization of pre-existing codes to create a unified routine to make radiative transfer modelling possible.
